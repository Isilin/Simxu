> **A:** Please visite the following website which will explain it better than us : <https://mw.lojban.org>. Lojban is used as a part of the simxu's lore we create along the game. The language itself was created with the idea of a non ambiguity in its meaning (a reason why their is several (long) means to express the meaning of the word "symbiosis" in Lojban) so a possibility to make it parsable which could be an interesting gameplay experience. A natural language doesn't have these particularities.
