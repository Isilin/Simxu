## F.A.Q.

### **Q:** Why "simxu" does not begin with a capital letter ? 
> **A:** Lojban doesnâ€™t use lower-case (small) letters and upper-case (capital) letters in the same way that English does; sentences do not begin with an upper-case letter, nor do names. However, upper-case letters are used in Lojban to mark irregular stress within names. - **The Complete Lojban Language by John Woldemar Cowan**
